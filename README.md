# Service-Exchange-Keys-101
An introductory assignment for learning public/private-key exchange.
Recommended level:
- Ability to code and understand python
- Some basic understanding of networks

Please read Background.md to gain some understanding of Key-Exchange.

## Environment Setup
Linux + Python3. Other environments not tested, but all UNIX environments should work.

Run `sudo python3 -m test.py`.

Why does this program need sudo? [It turns out, to create a socket in Linux, one needs root access](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/244635/why-do-i-need-root-privileges-to-send-a-raw-packet-from-a-unix-machine).

## Notes
You should only be modifying the client.py file. Other files are system libraries.

## Task 1
Implement SAT sharing with basic calculations. The framework is already included.

## Task 2
Implement a instruction send + the instruction. The framework is already included.

## Task 3
IP.

# Discussion and need help?
We will review the program in lecture.
